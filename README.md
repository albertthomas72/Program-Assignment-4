Everything worked! I couldn't see the image because you didn't push the image to github, but I can see that it was successfully added in you app. Just one little thing: your first line of code, setting the background color as "gold", that is not a color that Titanium identifies. Therefore, the gold background color would not have showed up. You can look at here, under the color section, for more explanation: http://docs.appcelerator.com/titanium/3.0/#!/api/Titanium.UI
